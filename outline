Do pre-expansion teams continue to win more consistently than expansion teams even after any effects of expansion should have worn off? 

	Define expansion team:

	When does expansion effect wear off?
		Is there a relationship between the number of years a team has existed and its expected win percentage?
		Limit to first 10? 15? years
			Any team that's existed for any amount of time can still lose an ungodly amount of games but I hypothesise that a new team should be more expected to lose an ungodly amount
		Time to first winning season? First playoff berth?
